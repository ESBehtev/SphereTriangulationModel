# Sphere Triangulation Model
Sphere Triangulation Model implemented in OpenGL using Xcode.
This project demonstrates the creation and rendering of a 3D sphere, triangulated into smaller polygons for visualization. Utilizing modern OpenGL libraries, the program implements basic lighting, smooth shading, and real-time rotation to simulate realistic surface effects. Designed to run in Xcode with adjustable parameters for experimentation and learning.
